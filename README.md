# Samiki-Project (Bot Version)

#### I decided to turn our dear Samiki waifu into a bot for Discord (I'm a verified bot developer)

###### Main project language = JavaScript

This part of the project is separate from the main project, so I decided to put it in the same repository but with a different Readme, because of that this session has a huge title.

I still have no idea of ​​all the functionality modules that I will put in our dear Samiki, but you can be sure that the game will be included in the bot version too.
